This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict Walmart sales based on various input features. The application, built using Streamlit, provides an interactive interface for users to input data and obtain sales forecasts, facilitating better business decisions and planning.

## Overview

The Walmart Sales Prediction project utilizes machine learning algorithms to forecast future sales based on historical data and external factors. The Streamlit application offers a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model and exploring the predictions.

### Key Features

- **Sales Prediction**:
  - Predict future sales based on input features such as store type, CPI, unemployment rate, fuel price, and temperature.
  - Provides forecasted sales values with confidence intervals.

- **Interactive Interface**:
  - Streamlit-based web application for easy data entry and prediction generation.
  - Real-time feedback on predictions as users adjust input parameters.

- **Data Visualization**:
  - Visualization of historical sales data and prediction results.
  - Interactive charts and graphs to explore sales trends and model performance.

## Machine Learning

### Model Overview

- **Algorithms Used**:
  - The project employs machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to model the relationship between input features and sales.

- **Training and Evaluation**:
  - The model is trained on historical sales data and evaluated using performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared.
  - Cross-validation techniques are applied to ensure robust performance.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Key features such as store type, CPI, unemployment rate, fuel price, and temperature are engineered to enhance the model's predictive accuracy.
  - Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

### Analysis

- **Historical Sales Analysis**:
  - Examination of past sales trends and seasonal patterns to inform the model.
  - Analysis of correlations between sales and input features.

- **Prediction Accuracy**:
  - Evaluation of model accuracy through metrics and validation techniques.
  - Analysis of prediction errors and model performance.

- **Scenario Analysis**:
  - Exploration of how changes in input features affect sales predictions.
  - Sensitivity analysis to identify key factors influencing sales forecasts.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis and model development.
- **Streamlit**: For creating interactive web applications.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning model building and evaluation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
